# Random Forest Forecasting - Implementation Guide

## 🌲 Overview

The forecasting system now uses **Random Forest Regressor** from scikit-learn to predict product demand. This is a powerful ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make accurate predictions.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Algorithm**: Random Forest Regressor

- **Model**: `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`
- **Ensemble**: 100 decision trees
- **Max Depth**: 10 levels per tree
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded (`n_jobs=-1`)

### **Features Used for Training** (7 features per data point)

1. **Day of Week** (0-6): Monday=0, Sunday=6
2. **Day of Month** (1-31): Date within the month
3. **Week of Year** (1-53): ISO calendar week number
4. **Month** (1-12): Month of the year
5. **Lag 1**: Previous day's sales quantity
6. **Lag 7**: Sales from 7 days ago (weekly pattern)
7. **Rolling Avg**: 7-day moving average

### **Training Process**

```python
# 1. Query 90 days of sales history
history = sales data for last 90 days

# 2. Build feature matrix for each historical day
for each day in history:
    features = [day_of_week, day_of_month, week_of_year, month, 
                lag_1, lag_7, rolling_avg_7d]
    target = actual_sales_quantity

# 3. Train Random Forest
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, max_depth=10)
model.fit(features, targets)

# 4. Predict future days
for each future day (1 to 30):
    prediction = model.predict(future_features)
```

## 📊 Model Configuration

```python
RandomForestRegressor(
    n_estimators=100,        # Number of trees in the forest
    max_depth=10,            # Maximum depth of each tree
    min_samples_split=2,     # Min samples to split a node
    min_samples_leaf=1,      # Min samples at leaf node
    random_state=42,         # Reproducibility
    n_jobs=-1                # Use all CPU cores
)
```

## 🔢 Feature Engineering

### **Temporal Features**
- Capture cyclical patterns (weekly, monthly)
- Day of week: handles weekday vs weekend differences
- Week of year: captures seasonal trends

### **Lag Features**
- **Lag 1**: Captures short-term momentum
- **Lag 7**: Captures weekly seasonality (e.g., "Saturdays are always busy")

### **Rolling Statistics**
- **7-day average**: Smooths out noise, shows recent trend

### **Recursive Forecasting**
- For day 1: uses actual historical lags
- For day 2+: uses predicted values as lags
- Creates realistic multi-step forecasts

## 📈 Advantages of Random Forest

✅ **Non-linear**: Captures complex relationships  
✅ **Robust**: Handles outliers and missing patterns well  
✅ **Feature interactions**: Automatically learns day-of-week × lag interactions  
✅ **No assumptions**: Doesn't assume linear trends or specific distributions  
✅ **Ensemble**: Averages 100 trees → reduces overfitting

## 🧪 Requirements

### **Minimum Data**
- **14 days** of sales history (vs 7 for exponential smoothing)
- More data = better predictions (up to 90 days used)

### **Dependencies**
```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy flask flask-cors
```

## 🎯 API Endpoints (Unchanged)

### **Single Product Forecast**
```http
GET /forecasts/product/123?days=30
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "product_id": 123,
  "forecast_days": 30,
  "forecasts": [
    {
      "forecast_date": "2025-10-31",
      "predicted_demand": 28.5,
      "season_factor": 1.12,
      "market_factor": 1.15,
      "confidence_level": 0.87
    },
    ...
  ],
  "source": "ml"
}
```

## 🔍 What Changed from Exponential Smoothing?

| Aspect | Exponential Smoothing | Random Forest |
|--------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Algorithm** | Holt's Linear | Ensemble Trees |
| **Features** | None (only sequence) | 7 time-series features |
| **Min Data** | 7 days | 14 days |
| **Complexity** | Simple, fast | More complex, slower |
| **Captures** | Trend + seasonality | Non-linear patterns |
| **Training** | No explicit training | Trains on historical data |
| **Prediction** | Formula-based | Tree ensemble voting |

## 🚀 Performance

- **Training time**: ~50-200ms per product (100 trees)
- **Prediction time**: ~10-30ms per forecast
- **Total per product**: ~100-300ms (acceptable for web UI)

## 🎓 When Random Forest Excels

✅ Products with **irregular patterns** (not smooth trends)  
✅ Data with **sudden spikes** or promotions  
✅ **Non-linear seasonality** (e.g., holiday effects)  
✅ **Feature-rich** scenarios (we use 7 features)  

---

## 📝 Notes

- The `season_factor` and `market_factor` are still calculated for reporting (same as before)
- `confidence_level` is based on coefficient of variation, not Random Forest's internal variance
- Future enhancement: use Random Forest's tree variance for better confidence scores
- Model is retrained on every API call with latest data (no caching yet)

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

1. **Add more features**: price, promotions, holidays, weather
2. **Hyperparameter tuning**: GridSearch for optimal n_estimators/max_depth
3. **Confidence from ensemble**: Use prediction variance across 100 trees
4. **Model caching**: Store trained models for 5-15 minutes
5. **Feature importance**: Show which features drive predictions
